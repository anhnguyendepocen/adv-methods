Exam 1 Study Guide
================

All readings and lectures are fair game. The exam will focus on the topics covered in the homeworks and quizzes, especially the key topics below. A mastery of the skills below for a logit or probit model is the minimum for passing the exam. 

1. Given an inverse link function $g^{-1}$ and $Pr(y_i) = g^{-1}(X_i\beta)$, calculate the marginal effect of $x_1$. 
2. Start with the model above and derive the log-likelihood function. I'll give you the equation for the pdf/pmf and link function. You should also be able to derive the MLE for a generic distribution (without covariates, e.g., beta, binomial, Poisson), including analytical optimization if reasonable.
3. Describe how the standard errors and variance-covariance matrix are calculated.
4. Write down the invariance principle and describe how it is used.
5. Describe the process for obtaining confidence intervals for quantities of interest via simulation. Be familiar with how to calculate a predicated probability, first-difference, second-difference, and risk-ratio.
