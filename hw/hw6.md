Homework 6
==========

Since we just had an exam, let's do a light week. We'll push back a computational and application problem for count models into next week.

## Background Reading

Read Long, ch. 8, which is in the Dropbox folder.

## Theory

Calculate the marginal effect of $x_1$ on $E(y_i)$ for a Poisson regression model where $E(y_i) = e^{X_i \beta}$.

## Quiz Questions

* Describe predictive simulation in detail. See the slides.
* Calculate the marginal effect for a Poisson regression model.
* Describe the main advantage of a negative binomial model over a Poisson model.
