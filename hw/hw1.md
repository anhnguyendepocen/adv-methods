## Foundational Tools

1. Choose how you are going to version-control your files. I use Dropbox to sync my files across my iMac, MacBook, iPad, and iPhone and Git to version control everything. You need to have a strategy in place before you start the project.

2. Start to think about what paper you want to replicate. Try to have one or two picked out by the beginning of the next class so that we can begin to discuss them.
