## Maximum Likelihood Estimation

This week is probably the most important in the whole semester. There are two extremely general concepts we'll discuss this semester: maximum likelihood and simulation. These two ideas are extremely powerful and even more so when used together. It is crucial that you understand the key ideas of maximum likelihood estimation. I've given one medium-length reading this week. Please read it carefully.

## Quiz Questions

* Find the probability of *X* if *x* has distribution *p(x)*, where *X* is a specific event (or set of events) and *p(x)* is a pdf or pmf.

### In Class

* Derive a likelihood function for a simple binomial model. Program this function in R. Produce some fake data (perhaps with dice). Plug in several values to find the one that produces the highest likelihood (i.e., a brute force search). Confirm answer using a plot of the likelihood function. Confirm answer using derivatives.
* Repeat for an exponential distribution.
* Think about how we might go about climbing a hill using a computer algorithm. Perhaps we can actually implement something workable? 
* Introduce and demonstrate the `optim()` function in R.
