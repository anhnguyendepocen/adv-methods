## Maximum Likelihood Estimation

This week is probably the most important in the whole semester. There are two extremely general concepts we'll discuss this semester: maximum likelihood and simulation. These two ideas are extremely powerful and even more so when used together. It is crucial that you understand the key ideas of maximum likelihood estimation, which is what we'll be studying this week. I've given one medium-length reading this week. Please read it **carefully**.

* King, Gary. 2001. *Unifying Political Methodology: The Likelihood Theory of Statistical Inference.* University of Michigan Press. Chapters 1-4. [Dropbox]

* Suppose that you flip a (possibly biased) coin *n* times and observe *y* heads. Find the maximum likelihood estimate of *p = Pr(Head)*.
	* Derive the log-likelihood function.
	* Solve the log-likelihood function analytically (i.e., with calculus).
	* What is the maximum likelihood estimate of *p*?
* Suppose that take a single draw from a normal distribution with unknown mean *u* and known variance 1. You obtain *y = 1.2*.
	* Derive the log-likelihood function for this single observation.
	* Solve the log-likelihood function analytically (i.e., with calculus).
	* What is the maximum likelihood estimate of *u*?

## Quiz Questions

* For a given probability model *Y ~ binomial(n, y, p)*, derive the log-likelihood function and solve for the MLE.

### In Class

* MLE with multiple observations. 
* Hill-climbing algorithms.
* Extend MLE to probability models with covariates.
* Derive estimates for the MLE of normal-linear model.
