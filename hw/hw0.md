Homework 0 
==========

Due Wednesday, August 27 (i.e., before our first class).

## Syllabus
* Read the [syllabus](https://github.com/carlislerainey/adv-methods/blob/master/syllabus.md) on GitHub.

## Replication

One of the most important things we'll do this semester is write a paper that makes a substantive contribution. These easiest way to get to the cutting edge (before making your *tiny* step forward) is to replicate the best work. These readings give the background.

* King, Gary. 2006. "[Publication, Publication](http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/paperspub.pdf)." PS: Political Science and Politics 39: 119â€“125. Also read [these updates](http://gking.harvard.edu/papers).
* "[How to Persuade Journals to Accept Your Replication Paper](http://politicalsciencereplication.wordpress.com/2013/09/11/guest-blog-how-to-persuade-journals-to-accept-your-replication-paper/)." A blog post by Mark Bell and Nicholas Miller.

## Version-Control
 
Everything we do in this class will be open and replicable. In order to promote maximum transparency, I use Git and GitHub to publicly version-control all of my papers. We'll use this approach to maintain the course notes. If you want to use some other methods for version-control, feel free (Dropbox is the easiest). However, you must at a *minimum* provide a replication folder toward the end of the semester that contains the data and code to replicate all of your empirical results. I recommend that you post this folder and the paper publicly once you have a faculty member give it a look. 

* Bowers, Jake. [Six Steps to a Better Relationship with Your Future Self.](http://polmeth.wustl.edu/methodologist/tpm_v18_n2.pdf)
* Ram, Karthik. 2013. "[Git Can Facilitate Greater Reproducibility and Increased Transparency in Science](http://www.scfbm.org/content/pdf/1751-0473-8-7.pdf)." *Source Code for Biology and Medicine* 8:7.
* Rainey, Carlisle. "[How I Use Git and GitHub for Political Science Research](https://github.com/carlislerainey/git-for-political-science/blob/master/git.md)." (This is just a work in progress, but it does give a decent overview of Git/GitHub basics.)

## Actual Research

* "[My Paper's Journey Through the Review Process](https://pages.wustl.edu/nathanjensen/articles/6010)." A blog post by Nathan Jensen.
* "[William Shockley on What Makes a Person Who Publishes a Lot of Papers](http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/william-shockley-on-what-makes-a-person-write-a-lot-of-papers-and-the-superstar-researcher-system/)." A blog post by Brian McGill.
* Silva, Paul. 2007. *How to Write a Lot.* Chapters 2 and 3. (Dropbox)

## LaTeX, Markdown, Git, R

We'll talk about these in class, so be sure to bring your computer and make sure that you have LaTeX, Git, R, and RStudio installed. You can easily find the guides you need for your operating system with a quick Google search.

## Quiz Questions

None this week, we'll start the graded stuff next week.
