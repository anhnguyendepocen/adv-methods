This is the GitHub repository for the advanced political methodology class I'm teaching for our Ph.D. students at the University at Buffalo in Fall 2014. This is a work in progress, but if you see potential improvements, you can raise an issue or submit a pull request.

You can find the course webpage at [crain.co/am](http://crain.co/am).
