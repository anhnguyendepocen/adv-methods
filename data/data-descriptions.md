Data Descriptions
=================

* `bde.dta` (logistic regression): The interaction of education and registration restrictions in influence the decision to turn out to vote. From [Berry, DeMeritt, and Esarey (2010)](http://www.carlislerainey.com/am-files/papers/BerryDeMerittEsarey2010.pdf).
* `challenger.csv` (logistic regression): The effect of temperature on o-ring failure. See [Dalal, Fowlkes, and Hoadley (1989)](http://psychweb.psy.umt.edu/denis/datadecision/challenger.pdf) for the details. `n` is the number of o-rings, `damage` is the number of damaged o-rings, and `temp` is the air temperature at launch. The space shuttle challenger launched in 31 degree temperatures. What predictions might we make about the chance of o-ring failure?
* `fearon-laitin.dta` (logistic regression): The effect of several variables on the chance of civil war. See [Fearon and Laitin (2003)](http://www.carlislerainey.com/am-files/papers/FearonLaitin2003.pdf).
* `heller-mershon.csv` (logistic regression): The effect of party discipline on switching. From [Heller and Mershon (2008)](http://www.carlislerainey.com/am-files/papers/HellerMershon2008.pdf).
* `krupnikov.csv` (logistic regression): The effect of negativity on turning out to vote. See [Krupnikov (2011)](http://www.carlislerainey.com/am-files/papers/Krupnikov2011.pdf) for the details. These data are used to estimate the models in her Table 2. How robust are these results to alternative model specifications?
