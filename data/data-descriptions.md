Data Descriptions
=================

* `challenger.csv` (logistic regression): The effect of temperature on o-ring failure. See [Dalal, Fowlkes, and Hoadley (1989)](http://psychweb.psy.umt.edu/denis/datadecision/challenger.pdf) for the details. `n` is the number of o-rings, `damage` is the number of damaged o-rings, and `temp` is the air temperature at launch. The space shuttle challenger launched in 31 degree temperatures. What predictions might we make about the chance of o-ring failure?
* `krupnikov.csv` (logistic regression): The effect of negativity on turning out to vote. See [Krupnikov (2011)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00522.x/abstract) for the details. How robust are these results to alternative model specifications?
* `fearon-laitin.dta` (logistic regression): The effect of several variables on the chance of civil war. See [Fearon and Laitin (2003)](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=142717&fileId=S0003055403000534).
