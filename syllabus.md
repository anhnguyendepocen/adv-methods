## Course Information

Course Number: PSC 631  
Meeting: Wednesday, 2:00-4:50, in Park 502

Office: Park 418  
Office Hours: Monday, 1:00-2:00  

## Description

Our goal main goal this semester is to extend the linear model in several ways and write papers about applications of those models. The class of models we'll focus on are sometimes referred to as "maximum likelihood models," but I usually call them "generalized linear models." The key motivation is to adapt from continuous-ish outcomes to binary, categorical, count, time-to-event, and other outcomes. As needed, we can focus on other topics. I also care a lot about computation, so we'll do a lot of programming 

## Prerequisites

You should definitely feel quite comfortable with the material from PSC 531. We'll be moving *much* faster this semester. In 531, we spent one semester on a single model. We'll cover dozens in this class.

## Textbooks

There is no assigned textbook for the class. Instead, we'll draw as needed from several books and I'll place any readings not available on the web in our Dropbox folder.

In case you like to have an actual textbook, here are some good ones.

* Long, J. Scott. 1997. *Regression Models for Categorial and Limited Dependent Variables.*
* Farraway, Julian J. 2006. *Extending the Linear Model with R.*
* Fox, John. 2008. *Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized Linear Models.*

## Grading

I ultimately care about each of you leaving the class with a fantastic paper that you can submit to a conference and perhaps a journal. However, I have set up the class to have graded assignments throughout the class that make sure you are building the skills necessary to write a fantastic research paper and critique others' work. You can expect problem sets that focus on statistical theory and mathematics, homework assignments that ask you to do computation in R, including some that ask you to use fake data, my data, and your own data. I design all the assignments so that you are building up the skill sets to write papers in political science. While I care deeply about applied analysis, there are some things that you simply need to know in order to do good research. Expect in-class quizzes that focus on these things. I will provide some guidance about what you can expect to appear on these quizzes.

### Homework (10%)

You should expect one homework assignment per week that will be graded as percent correct. The homework is assigned on Wednesday and due at the beginning of the next class. I expect you to get all the homework problems correct. You can talk to me or classmates as needed, but you will learn the most if you put in effort on your own before seeking help. 

The point of the homework is not to make you do busy-work, but to give you the opportunity to engage with the material. I suggest you adopt the following strategy. Answer as many questions as you can by yourself. If you encounter difficulties, take the following steps. First, think hard about it--really hard--for at least thirty minutes. If you have time, sleep on it. If you still cannot figure it out, then ask a classmate or two. Share ideas with each other an try to get unstuck. If your group of two or three cannot complete the problem, come see me. (Note: I understand that many people work better in groups, but the approach of "you do half, I'll do half" or "I'll do this week's, you do next" is not appropriate. If I believe this is going on, you can expect the difficulty of the quizzes to increase.)

Turn in your problem sets at the beginning of class on Wednesday. I'll offer instructions on how submit your answers (i.e., typewritten, hand-written, or source code) for each assignment. Make sure that whatever you turn in is neat. If it is not done neatly, I will not grade it.

### In-Class Quizzes (10%) 

While I care deeply about applied statistics (as opposed to the abstract, theoretical stuff), there are some things that you must know to do good applied work. As such, I'll give you a list of about five possible questions for each class that will come from recent readings, lectures, or class discussions. We'll randomly choose one or more to answer at the beginning of each class.

### Exams (20% + 20% = 40%)

We're going to have two exams this semester. The midterm will probably be a 75 minute in-class exam and the final exam will probably be during finals week, though I'm open to suggestions on this. The point is to force us to stop and collect our thoughts once during and again at the end of the semester. The exam questions will come directly from the potential quiz questions. 

We'll discuss the details closer to exam time.

### Participation (10%)

You must bring something to this class. There are many things I am happy to do for you, but lecture everything you need to know is not one of them. Every week, I expect you to engage the readings, reflect on the previous class(es), and make progress on your papers. Every class, I expect you to contribute something that your colleagues will find valuable--it might be pointing out something incorrect that I've said, asking a relevant question, suggesting a better or different way to approach a question, or offer your colleagues valuable feedback. During class, I want everyone to make *at least* one contribution. During class (whenever convenient), write describe your contribution on a sheet of paper in a sentence or two. After class, hand it to me. I will read it briefly and either accept it or reject it. If I accept it, I will add it to my folder. If I reject it, I will hand it back to you and you can do with it what you choose. I will give everyone a free class. At the end of the semester, I will divided with number of slips I have from you by the number of meetings minus one. That is your participation score.

To facilitate this, I highly recommend having a notebook, Word document, Evernote note, or something similar in which you keep thoughts about your projects and the course material. These can be questions, comments, or suggestions that you think your classmates will benefit from. For example, you might find an excellent resource that helps you structure your daily writing routine. You might find an excellent example that illustrates a key idea for the course. You might read a paper that other students might want to read (or I might want to add to the syllabus). You might find an R package that does something useful. You might write code that automatically handles some task and share it with the class. You might find some new result while working on your project. You should share all of these ideas with the class. If you feel uncomfortable just jumping in, you can send me a brief e-mail before class and I will find a good time for you to make your contribution. 

**Note**: I didn't do a good job enforcing this last semester. I'm going to do better this semester.

### Research (Replication) Paper (30%)

The most important thing we do in this class is a replication paper. I need to approve your plan, but I'll consider a wide range of ideas about what your paper will look like. However, I feel strongly that it should be a replication. Feel free to coauthor with one or more students. I expect this paper to be high-quality (think about it being ready for a conference at the very worst). Near the end of the semester, you will turn in to me the following:

* **A high-quality manuscript.** This paper should make a contribution to a political science literature, look fantastic, be well-written, and have few (ideally no) typos. It should be shorter, rather than longer (think 10-15 pages; [Bell and Miller](http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/12/06/0022002713499718) is a good example). If I do not feel comfortable suggesting that you submit the paper to a conference, then you will not get a very good grade. However, I have structured the course so that you should do a good job if you put in the time.
* **A replication data set.** Near the end of the semester, I will assign another student the task of replicating your tables and figures starting with the raw data set. If they cannot, you will not get a very good grade.
* **A conference-style presentation.** It is part of my job to prepare you for a conference--you are training to be political scientists. Toward the end of the semester, I will give you the opportunity to make a conference-style presentation. I will fill in the details later, but for now, you should be thinking ten minutes, making every minute count.

Each of these components should fit nicely together to give you a project that you can (1) ask a faculty member in the department to read, and, with their approval, (2) submit to a conference and/or journal.

|	Grade |	Points | Grade | Points	|
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| A	    | 93-100  | C    | 73-76.9|
| A-    | 90-92.9 | C-   | 70-72.9|
| B+    | 87-89.9 | D+   | 67-69.9|
| B	    | 83-86.9 | D    | 60-66.9|
| B-    | 80-82.9 | F	   | < 60	  |
| C+    | 77-79.9 | 	   |		    |

### Daily Writing (5%, optional) 

The most important step you can take to be a productive scholar is write *daily*. The best advice I can give you to help you get a job is to schedule your writing time every day and protect that time like you would protect your teaching time. You would not skip a class because you did not feel like teaching or because you did not feel like you had anything good today. Treat writing like you treat teaching and you will be a productive researcher. If you are interested in this option, just let me know. He will set up a spreadsheet so that we can hold each other accountable to a daily writing routine. I plan to participate and you should too. Some (but not all) of the assigned homework can contribute toward your writing time. I encourage each of you to pursue this option.

This is a public commitment that you are making to write routinely. I schedule 2 hours every weekday morning before doing anything else, but you might want to do something different. If I miss a day, I will explain why in class and I expect you to do the same. 

## Missed Classes

This is a graduate class, so make sure that you attend. If you have more than one unexcused absence, I reserve the right to lower your grade in the class.

Excused absences include documented illness, deaths in the family and other documented crises, call to active military duty or jury duty, religious holy days, and official University activities. These absences will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize students who have a valid excuse. Consideration will also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness.

## Cheating

The UB Academic Integrity Policy outlines the University's expectations for the integrity of students' academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process. Students are responsible for reading and adhering to the [Undergraduate Academic Integrity Policy](http://undergrad-catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/course/integrity.shtml).

I expect you to fulfill assignments honestly and honorably. Plagiarism and cheating are serious forms of academic misconduct. Examples of each are given in the Integrity Policy mentioned above. If I detect cheating or plagiarism on any course assignment, I reduce your grade on the assignment or course, and may assign an F in the course. First, I inform you (preferably in writing) as soon as possible after the incident. Then I discuss the matter with you, and put any agreement regarding academic penalty in writing signed by both of us. Finally, I report the infraction to the Chair and the Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education. If no agreement can be reached, I simply make a recommendation as describing the the Integrity policy mentioned above.
